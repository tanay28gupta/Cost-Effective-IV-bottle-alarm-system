# Smart IV Bottle Alarm System

## Overview
The **Smart IV Bottle Alarm System** is an advanced medical monitoring device designed to **prevent IV fluid depletion** in hospitals and healthcare centers. This system continuously tracks the **weight of the IV bottle** and alerts medical staff when the fluid level drops below a **critical threshold**. It enhances patient care by ensuring timely IV bottle replacement and reducing manual supervision.

## Objectives
- **Automate IV fluid level monitoring** to prevent accidental depletion.
- **Notify medical staff** via LED indicators and SMS alerts when the fluid is low.
- **Ensure patient safety** by reducing human errors in IV fluid management.

## How It Works
1. The **load cell** measures the weight of the IV bottle and sends the data to an **HX711 module**, which converts the analog signal to digital.
2. The **Arduino microcontroller** processes the weight data and displays it on an **LCD screen**.
3. When the **IV fluid level is critically low**, the system triggers:
   - A **LED indicator** for visual alert.
   - An **SMS notification** via the **GSM module** to inform medical staff.
   - A **buzzer alarm** (optional) for an audible warning.

## Key Features
✔ **Real-time weight monitoring** using a load cell and HX711 module.  
✔ **SMS alerts** via a GSM module when fluid is low.  
✔ **LED and buzzer indicators** for immediate visual and audible warnings.  
✔ **LCD display** showing current IV bottle weight.  
✔ **Easy threshold customization** for different IV fluid types.  

## Applications
- 🏥 Hospitals & Clinics  
- 🏡 Home Healthcare Services  
- 💉 Elderly & ICU Patient Monitoring  
- 🚑 Remote Medical Assistance  

## Advantages
✅ **Reduces manual IV monitoring efforts**  
✅ **Enhances patient safety & care**  
✅ **Prevents IV fluid depletion risks**
